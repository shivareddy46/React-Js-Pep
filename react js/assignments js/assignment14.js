//create a class called shape with properties color and name. Add a getter method called area of the shape.
//create a subclass called circle that extends the shape class. Add a constructorthat takes additional property radius

//create a subclass called rectangle that extends the shape class.Add a constructor that tkes properties width and height and

//create an instance of the circle with radius of 5. Call the area getter on the instance and print the result.
//create an instance of rectangle class with a width of 4 and a height of 6. call the area getter on the instance and print the result.
//Add a setter method called name to the shape class that sets the name of the shape to the given value. Override the setter in the Rectangle
